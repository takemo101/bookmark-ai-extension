# asem

Use asem to run and coordinate local AI CLI Sessions in terminal multiplexers. It records durable Messages and Reports, but it does not judge whether work succeeded.

## When to use

Use asem when work benefits from:

- a separate agent Session;
- durable Messages/Reports;
- independent review;
- workspace/repo scoped supervision.

Do not use asem as a task manager or workflow engine.

## Use MCP first

Prefer MCP tools when available:

- `create_session`
- `send_message`
- `list_messages`
- `report_parent`
- `close_session`

Fallback CLI commands:

- `asem session create`
- `asem message send`
- `asem message wait`
- `asem report parent`
- `asem session close`
- `asem workspace repo list`

## Normal playbook

1. Create a bounded worker Session.
2. Wait for its Report.
3. For non-trivial work, create a separate reviewer Session.
4. If review blocks, send the worker a Message with repair instructions.
5. Repeat until acceptable.
6. Close child Sessions; do not delete history unless explicitly asked.

## Workspace repo aliases

A Repo Alias is a named cwd shortcut. If the Workspace root `.asem.yaml` defines `repos`, use:

```sh
asem workspace repo list
asem session create frontend-parent --repo frontend --root --prompt "Act as the parent Session for frontend work."
```

--repo is only a cwd alias. It does not create cross-worktree Parent/Message/Report semantics. Parent/Child, Message, and Report behavior remains normal same-scope behavior inside the target repo.

Repo parent Sessions create their own repo-local child Sessions. Use `asem tui --scope workspace` when a human needs to inspect multiple repos together.

## Boundaries

- Session status is process state, not success/failure.
- Report is communication, not completion.
- Do not invent cross-worktree Parent/Report/Message semantics.
- Agent Profiles shape prompts; they are not workflow roles.
- Do not edit .asem runtime files directly, especially `.asem/sessions/`, `.asem/tokens/`, or `.asem/current-session*.json`.
